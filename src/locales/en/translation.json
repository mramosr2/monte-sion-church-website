      "We are a non-profit organization legally registered with state and federal authorities, and we have been established since 1995. We give thanks to God because He has allowed us to remain standing and to overcome every trial along the way. We have endured the scorn of our enemies, all kinds of curses, and all kinds of talk from people close to us, and God continues to support our ministry. We have never gone to bring people from other churches; instead, we seek that the Holy Spirit would bring to our churches those who are to be saved. That gives us peace and full satisfaction to keep preaching a real Gospel from a real Word—one that has mysteries between the lines that must be studied, and studied deeply, to satisfy our spiritual needs.",
      "Since we opened the church, God has prospered us immensely. Perhaps we have not had major growth in membership at the Central Church, but we have been able to establish works in different places and visit them constantly. Land has been purchased, churches have been built, sound equipment and instruments have been sent, pastors in need have been helped, and we have maintained payments for meeting locations for the preaching of the Gospel to this day. This gives us the assurance that God is in our midst and will continue with us, because we have seen that He has enlarged our tents, blessed us, and not allowed the enemy to destroy us. For where God opens, no one can shut; and where God shuts, no one can open.",
      "We remain on the front lines against ignorance of God’s Word, preaching the written truths and building awareness that only by preaching a real Gospel can we become true Christians. We cannot preach only what people want to hear; we preach the reality of what it is. We do not lie about the Scriptures. We are neither liberal nor legalistic. We speak the truth, and the truth will not only set us free—it may also trouble us in some way. “Not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing…”",
      "Jesus clearly said that the truth would set us free, but we cannot take freedom as license, because Scripture says that the one who sins belongs to the enemy. We want to build awareness in all people who come to the church with joy that we are free to worship, to praise, and to study the Holy Word."

Most of these are done to collect offerings for the upkeep of the church, and that helps us greatly with paying rent for the building, water, electricity, gas, and more. For this reason, we take this opportunity to welcome the collaboration of brothers and sisters, as well as those who are not yet brothers in Christ who come to participate in these activities. We trust God that the seed of the Gospel will be planted in their hearts so that one day they will recognize our Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior. “Not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing…”",

      "Over the years, we have shown that we feel the need to help our neighbor—near and far. We want the work of God to keep growing, and we ask God to grant us the privilege to do it for the years we have remaining. We desire that our young people also take interest in preaching and continue the legacy they have received throughout their growth—not only physical but spiritual—through the years they have heard the Word of God and through the example of their parents. We work to improve each day and to bring help and comfort to those most in need. For years we have had the privilege of holding what we call Christmas Events in the different communities where our churches are, bringing a moment of joy and seeing the smiles of children, and a “thank you” from parents—an appreciative smile from a happy mother—when she sees her child filled with joy. “Not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing…”",
      "We carry out evangelism campaigns in different places, seeking to pray the prayer of Jabez when he asked God; this action is remembered more as a request in prayer than as a heroic act.",
      "In his prayer, he asked God: (1) to bless him, (2) to help him in his work—“enlarge my territory,” (3) to be with him in everything he did, and (4) to keep him from evil and harm. Jabez recognized God as the true center of his work. That is what Mision Monte Sion desires: that God would lead us to where we should be, bring the people who will do the work without difficulties, and allow us to go very far in the work that was entrusted to us. Even more, we have a great friendship with the Christian Dental Association of Southern California, with whom we have worked together in several communities, in the department of"
